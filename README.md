## account state data and analysis for Euler Finance

The directory `/account_state_fetch` includes python code for fetching all account e and d token balances 
when the protocol was paused. The text file `/account_state_fetch/all_accounts.log` includes the balances.

Some initial analysis of `all_accounts.log` is in the `analysis` directory in the jupyter notebook file.
